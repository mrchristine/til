# Text2Speech
I like to read blog posts or news articles and there often seems to be a lot of them within a given day. While I'm away from my computer, I found a nice simple way to play the text on my mac. 
Open vim or some text editing tool and copy the body of text you want to listen to. 
```bash
cat text.tmp | say -r 320
```
Mac OS has a built in tool called `say` that allows you to read text and you can adjust the rate of words / minute. 
You can something similar on Google translate. This is a tip I read about when proof reading your own work. Use google translate to read the body of work back to you.  
I like using the terminal to adjust the speed.
