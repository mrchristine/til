# SpellCheck from Command Line

I was writing a blog post in Markdown and wanted a quick way to verify any spelling errors in my post. I found a nice utility that I could install. 
```bash
$ brew install aspell
$ aspell check _posts/path_to_blog.md
```
A nice utility shows up that allows you to verify any spelling errors.
